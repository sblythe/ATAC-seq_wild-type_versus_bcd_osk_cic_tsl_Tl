This repository contains BigWig formatted coverage data for *Drosophila* ATAC-seq "open" regions (< 100 bp fragments) at two timepoints (ZGA, Gastrulation) and two genotypes (wild-type, *bcd osk cic tsl Tl<sup>rm9</sup>*). This mutant combination effectively eliminates or flattens all maternal gradients.
The data are associated with a prior publication: [Soluri et al., eLife 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53916).
The data are average normalized counts per 10 bp window as mapped to the *Drosophila* genome, version **dm6**. Please see the cited work for additional details of how the samples were generated. Raw data is available through GEO/SRA at accession number [GSE141538](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE141538)

For both genotypes, single embryos were collected at either NC14 + 12 minutes (ZGA) or at NC14 + 72 minutes (Gastrulation). There are four samples in this dataset.
